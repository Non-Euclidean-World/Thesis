\section{Terrain problems} \label{sec:terrain_problems}
The main problem with terrain was performance.
Generating terrain is not a particularly resource-consuming task, however editing the terrain is.
The main challenge was making editing the terrain smooth.
To achieve that the terrain has to be updated at least 30 times per second which means that multiple chunks, each one having almost 7000 vertices have to be updated at least 30 times per second.
This process was so resource-consuming that it had to be moved to a separate thread as described in \autoref{sec:chunk-worker}.
However since the main thread is the one that communicates with the GPU and the physics engine, the main thread still had to be involved in the process.
This created many problems connected with making sure that there are no race conditions while maintaining performance.
The whole logic is described in detail in \autoref{sec:chunk-worker}.
