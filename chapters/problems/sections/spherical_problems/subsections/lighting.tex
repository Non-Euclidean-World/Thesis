\subsection{Lighting in the second semi-hypersphere}
The introduction of the translation matrix \ref{eq:translation-matrix-2} specific to the second semi-hypersphere (the one with negative $w$ coordinates) caused problems with porting vectors that we were not able to fully solve.
In particular, the point light sources and spotlights do not behave the same way as in the first semi-hypersphere.
