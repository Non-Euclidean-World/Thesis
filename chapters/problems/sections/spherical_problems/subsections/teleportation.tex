\subsection{Teleportation}
The teleportation mechanism described in \autoref{sub:teleportation} is far from a perfect solution.
When a model crosses the boundary of one region it has to be physically moved to a completely different position and its velocity has to be altered as well.
This causes a visible discontinuity in the object's movement.
The problem is even more apparent when the camera is being teleported.
Positions of the objects in the scene appear to be slightly different after the teleportation which causes an unpleasant impression of a sudden "jump".
