\chapter{Problems} \label{ch:problems}
While making the game many problems were encountered, fortunately, almost all of theme were solved.
This chapter is dedicated to both the ones that were solved and the ones that were not.
It will focus mostly on the problems specific to this game, meaning the problems connected to non-Euclidean geometry and terrain generation will be the main focus.
