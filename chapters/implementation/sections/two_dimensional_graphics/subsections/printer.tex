\subsection{\texttt{Printer} class}

The \texttt{Printer} class is responsible for printing text on the screen.
It has a static constructor in which it creates a texture with the alphabet.
To achieve that it uses the SkiaSharp library.
After the texture is created \texttt{Printer} creates an array of Rectangles that describe the position of each letter on the texture.
These rectangles are passed to the shader when the text is printed.
This way only one texture is passed to the shader and the shader uses the rectangles to get the correct letter from the texture which improves performance.
The class also provides a method for printing a letter which is used in another method to print whole strings.
There are also methods for printing strings with the specified corner at the specified position.
