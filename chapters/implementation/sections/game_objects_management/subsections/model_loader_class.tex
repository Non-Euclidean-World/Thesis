\subsection{\texttt{ModelLoader} class}\label{subsec:model_loader-class}

The model loader is responsible for loading models from the file system.
It loads COLLADA files using AssipmNet to convert them to model class objects.
Each vertex in the mesh of the model must be dependent on at most 4 bones.
It creates VAOs for each mesh of the model, stores them in the Model class object, loads a PNG file, and stores it in a Texture class object.
\todo{I think we could write more about the modeling process itself (not necessarily here).
    Give some screenshots from Blender as well.
    It was a lot of work after all}
