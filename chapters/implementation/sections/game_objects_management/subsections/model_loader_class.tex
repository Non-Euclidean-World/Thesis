\subsection{\texttt{ModelLoader} class}\label{subsec:model_loader-class}

The model loader is responsible for loading models from the file system.
It loads COLLADA files using AssimpNet to convert them to model class objects.
Each vertex in the mesh of the model must be dependent on at most four bones.
It creates VAOs\footnote{VAO stands for \textit{vertex array object} (an OpenGL Object).} for each mesh of the model, stores them in the Model class object, loads a PNG file, and stores it in a \texttt{Texture} class object.
