\subsection{\texttt{*Controller} classes}\label{subsec:controller-classes}
There are nine controller classes in the project:
\texttt{PlayerController},
\texttt{BotsController},
\texttt{ChunksController},
\texttt{ProjectilesController},
\texttt{VehiclesController},
\texttt{LightSourcesController},
\texttt{HudController},
\texttt{BoundingShapesController}, and
\texttt{SkyboxController}.

All the controller classes serve the same purpose.
They exist to render objects and deal with object callbacks.
For example, \texttt{ProjectilesController} renders all existing projectiles and also removes the dead projectiles from the scene.
Each projectile has a \texttt{IsAlive} property which is read every time a render frame callback is called by the controller to check if the projectile is still alive.
