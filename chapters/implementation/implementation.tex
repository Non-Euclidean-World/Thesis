\chapter{Implementation} \label{ch:implementation}
The \textit{Hyper} video game is a relatively big project (it comprises around 260 classes), so naturally we have to contain the discussion to only the most important parts of the system.
Conceptually, there are four different "areas" spanned by the project:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item game objects management,
  \item procedural world generation,
  \item rendering,
  \item user interface.
\end{enumerate}

In what follows, we will discuss these areas in more detail.
We will also provide information on the technologies used in the project and present its core components.

\todo{I removed the "Bots management" section. I think there wouldn't be much to write about that anyway.}
