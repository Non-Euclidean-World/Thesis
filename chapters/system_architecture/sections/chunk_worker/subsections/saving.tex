\subsection{Saving chunks}
Saving chunks is handled by a process similar to the one discussed in \autoref{subsec:loading-and-generating}.
On each frame, the main thread in the \texttt{DeleteChunks} function determines which chunks are too far from the player and thus should be removed from the game and saved to disk.
Positions of these chunks are enqueued into the \texttt{chunksToSave} queue, and their resources are freed.

The worker thread dequeues chunks' positions from the \texttt{chunksToSave} queue and saves the scalar field associated with a given chunk on the disk.
