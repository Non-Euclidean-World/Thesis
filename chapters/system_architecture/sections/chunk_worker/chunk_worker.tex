\section{Chunk worker} \label{sec:chunk-worker}
The majority of the game logic is handled by a single thread.
The only two exceptions are the physics engine (external library) and the chunk management system.
The chunk management system is split between two threads: the main thread (the thread that the rest of the application is running on) and the \textit{chunk worker's} thread.
The worker's thread is concerned with operations that are either CPU-intensive or could take a long time to execute.
More specifically, the chunk worker is performing the following operations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item loading saved chunks from disk and generating new chunks,
    \item saving chunks to disk,
    \item updating chunks.
\end{enumerate}
The system is built around the producer-consumer pattern, i.e. the main thread communicates with the worker's thread (and \textit{vice versa}) using queues.
It's important to note that depending on the stage of an operation either thread can be the \textit{producer} or the \textit{consumer}.
We will now describe the workflow for each of the operations mentioned before.
