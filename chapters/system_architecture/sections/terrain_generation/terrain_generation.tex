\section{Terrain Generation} \label{sec:system_architecture_terrain_generation}
The terrain was designed to randomly generate so that the player can have a new, unique map every time they play.
The second important part of the design was making sure that the player could edit the terrain in any way they wanted.
As described in \autoref{sec:theory_theory_marching_cubes} the marching cubes algorithm was chosen as the base of the terrain generation process.
This section will describe how we used this algorithm to generate the terrain and allow the player to edit it.

The algorithm consists of the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define the scalar filed function.
    \item Divide the world into chunks.
    \item Generate the mesh.
\end{itemize}

Each of these steps will be described in detail in this section.
