The video game is written in C\# and uses OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) for the shaders.
The targeted platform is .NET 7 on Windows 10 and above.

The game relies on the following third-party libraries: \question{should links to there libraries be in footnotes or in bib?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item OpenTK\footnote{\url{https://github.com/opentk/opentk}} -- a set of low-level C\# bindings for OpenGL; used for 3D rendering,
    \item BepuPhysics2\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2}} -- a low-level, highly performant physics simulation library; used as the physics engine,
    \item SkiaSharp\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp}} -- API for rendering 2D images; used for 2D rendering (menus, controls, etc.),
    \item AssimpNet\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MonoGame/AssimpNet}} -- a .NET wrapper for the Open Asset Import (Assimp) library\footnote{\url{https://assimp.org/}}; used for loading models,
    \item StbImageSharp\footnote{\url{https://github.com/StbSharp/StbImageSharp}} -- C\# port of the \texttt{stb\_image.h} header file; used for loading images.
\end{itemize}
