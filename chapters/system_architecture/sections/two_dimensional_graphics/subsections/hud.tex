\subsection{Heads Up Display} \label{sec:hud}
The HUD encapsulates all the 2d elements that are drawn on top of the 3d scene while the game is runnings.
This includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Crosshair
    \item FPS counter
    \item Player position
    \item Inventory
\end{itemize}

The Crosshair is a simple cross in the middle of the screen.
It is used to help the player aim.
It consists of 2 lines and does not use any textures.

The FPS counter is a simple text that shows the current FPS.
It is drawn in the top right corner of the screen.
It uses the symbols texture.

The player position is a simple text that shows the current position of the player.
It is drawn in the top left corner of the screen.
It uses the symbols texture.

The inventory is a collection of images that represent the items the player has.
It is drawn at the bottom of the screen.
It uses both the textures.
The images of the items are drawn first and then the text is drawn on top of them.
It is done in this order to optimize the performance by minimizing the number of times a texture is set to 2.

All the elements of the HUD have their own positions and sizes.
Each element is either placed in some position on the screen or is placed relative to some other element.
