\subsection{Directional lighting} \label{subsec:directional-lighting}
The directional light in our game is the light cast by the sun.
The light direction $l$ is the vector pointing toward the sun.
During the night the directional light is much dimmer but still present.
In this case, the light direction $l$ is pointing toward an imaginary light source ("the stars") which is rotating along with the sky.
