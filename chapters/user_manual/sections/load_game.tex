\subsubsection{Load Game Screen}
The game can be loaded from the Load Game screen as shown in \autoref{fig:load_game}.
This screen displays your 9 most recent saves.
You can click on one of the saves to load it.
If you want to load a save that is older than that you have to delete your more recent saves using the "Delete Game" described in \autoref{delete_save_screen}
