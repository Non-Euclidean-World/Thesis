\section{New Game Screen}
The game can be started from the New Game screen shown in \autoref{fig:new_game}.
To start a game, the user has to click on the "Input Game Name" input text box.
This will allow them to enter a name for the game.
If there is no game save with the same name, the text box will light up green.
If there is already a game save with the same name, the text box will light up red.
If the box is green, the user can press one of the buttons to start a new game in the chosen geometry.
