\section*{Terrain Generation}
When designing the way the terrain is randomly generated so that we can have a new, unique map every time we play.
The second thing we wanted was to make sure that the player could edit the terrain in any way they wanted.
These two requirements made us decide on the algorithm described in this section.

The algorithm consists of the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generate a scalar field for the whole world.
    \item Divide the world into chunks.
    \item Generate the terrain.
\end{itemize}

Each of these steps will be described in more detail alter in this section.
