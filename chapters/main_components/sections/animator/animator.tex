\section{Animator}

The \texttt{Animator} class is responsible for animating the models loaded by \texttt{ModelLoader}.
It takes animation keyframes and interpolates them using Quaternion Slerp and Vector3 Lerp which are provided by AssimpNet.
It then uses the interpolated keyframes to calculate the transformation matrices for each bone in the model which are later passed to the shader.
