\section{Transporter}
The Transporter component is vital for the spherical geometry mode of the game.
It is responsible for transporting game objects between spheres.
All transporters implement the \texttt{ITransporter} interface.

Each game object has a property \texttt{CurrentSphereId} that attains one of two values: 0 or 1 depending on which sphere the object is currently in (this property is a part of \texttt{ISimulationMember} interface).
Whenever an object moves, the Transporter determines whether it should be transported to the opposing sphere by calculating the object's distance from its current sphere's center.

The transportation process changes the object's position and velocity.
In the case of objects modeled as compound bodies, it is necessary to alter the positions and velocities of each of the components.
When a camera is attached to an object that gets transported, it also has to be updated accordingly.
More specifically, the Transporter transforms the camera's front vector and updates the information about the camera's current sphere.

The functionalities mentioned above are only relevant in the spherical geometry mode.
To make the system design consistent across all modes, there is also a \texttt{NullTransporter} implementation of the \texttt{ITransporter} interface which is used in hyperbolic and Euclidean geometry modes.
This is a dummy class with methods that don't do anything.
