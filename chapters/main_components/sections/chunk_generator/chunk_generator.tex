\section{Chunk Generator} \label{chunk_generator}
\todo{we should describe that the scalar field generation is different for spherical space ("stitching the spheres")}
The Chunk Generator component is responsible for procedural terrain generation.
The generation process is encapsulated inside the \texttt{ChunkFactory} class.

A chunk is generated in two main steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A scalar field of a given size is created.
          The values of the scalar field are generated based on the values of Perlin noise.
          This step is performed by the \texttt{ScalarFieldGenerator} class.
    \item The marching cubes algorithm is used to create a mesh;
          positions and normal vectors of the mesh's vertices are obtained in this step using the \texttt{MeshGenerator} class.
\end{enumerate}
