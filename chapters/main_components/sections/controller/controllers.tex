\section{Controllers}

There are eight controller classes in the project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  \texttt{PlayerController}
    \item \texttt{BotsController}
    \item \texttt{ChunksController}
    \item \texttt{ProjectilesController}
    \item \texttt{VehiclesController}
    \item \texttt{LightSourcesController}
    \item \texttt{HudController}
    \item \texttt{BoundingShapesController}
    \item \texttt{SkyboxController}
\end{itemize}

All the controller classes serve the same purpose.
They exist to render objects and deal with object callbacks.
For example, \texttt{ProjectilesController} renders all existing projectiles and also removes the dead projectiles from the scene.
Each projectile has a \texttt{IsAlive} property which is read every time a render frame callback is called by the controller to check if the projectile is still alive.
