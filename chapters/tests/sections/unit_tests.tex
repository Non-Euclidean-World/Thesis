\section{Unit testing} \label{sec:unit_testing}
Unit testing was used to test particular methods and classes.
These tests check if the methods behave as expected.
However, even using mocking frameworks some things, in particular things connected to the graphics, cannot be unit tested.
Because of that the most important part of testing was manual testing described in \autoref{sec:manual_testing}.
