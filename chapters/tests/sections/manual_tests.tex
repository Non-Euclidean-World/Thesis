\section{Manual testing} \label{sec:manual_testing}
Manual testing is responsible for testing the game as a whole.
It tests the results and not particular methods or parts of the code.
Manual tests scenarios were created that describe in detail what should happen in the game after some actions are performed.
These tests cover the entirety of the application and can be viewed at \url{https://github.com/Non-Euclidean-World/HyperTesting}.
The tests are written as Markdown files that have references to image and video files that show the expected behavior of the game.
The test cases are divided into four parts:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Title - The name of the test case.
  \item Description - What the test case is supposed to test.
  \item Prerequisites - What has to be done before the test case can be performed.
  \item Steps - A table that describes the actions that have to be performed and their expected results.
\end{enumerate}

Below is an example of a test case.
It is important to note that the test case has been modified to fit the paper format by changing links to the images into references.
