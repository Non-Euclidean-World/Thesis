\chapter{Testing} \label{ch:testing}
Testing a video game is not an easy task and it differs substantially from testing other software.
In most software the most important thing is the functionality, however, in games, the visuals are just as important.
That means that testing if for example the player model was rendered is not enough; it also has to be tested if it was rendered correctly.
That is made even more difficult by the fact that the game uses the GPU to render the graphics.
All these difficulties make testing in code very difficult, which is why apart from unit testing we focused on manual testing which is a standard approach in the industry \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2103-06431}.
