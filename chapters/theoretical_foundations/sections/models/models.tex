\section{Models} \label{sec:theory_theory_models}
The game includes two characters and a car.
Both characters use the same model, and the same texture with different colors.
The car is simpler than the characters as it does hot have any animations.
Because of that this section will only focus on the player model.

The model can be divided into two parts.
The mesh part and the animation part.
What the two parts have in common is that they are both created in Blender, exported to a COLLADA file and loaded into the game using AssimpNet.
Both of these parts are described in this section.
