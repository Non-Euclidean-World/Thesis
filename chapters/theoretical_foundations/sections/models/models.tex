\section{Models} \label{sec:theory_theory_models}
There are two models used in the game: a character model and a car model.

The character model can be divided into two parts: the mesh part and the animation part.
What the two parts have in common is that they are both created in Blender, exported to a COLLADA file and loaded into the game using AssimpNet.
Both of these parts are described in this section.
