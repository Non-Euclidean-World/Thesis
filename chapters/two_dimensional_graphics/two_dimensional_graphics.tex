\section*{Two Dimensional Graphics} \label{chap:two_dimensional_graphics}
OpenGL is a low level graphics API.
It offers a set of functions to draw points, lines, and triangles.
It does not offer any functions to draw circles, ellipses, or other shapes.
That includes drawing text. 
Because of that adding the heads up display (HUD) and the Menu to the game is not as simple as we would like it to be.
In this chapter we describe how we draw 2d elements in our application.
