\section{World}
The world could be improved in multiple ways.
One such way would be to add shadows to the game.
Right now nothing casts any shadows but it would be interesting to see what shadows look like in non-Euclidean geometries.

Another improvement to the world would be to add clouds.
The sky is very empty during the day with only the suns visible.
Its better during the night but nevertheless clouds would make it look even better.

Perhaps the most important improvement to the world would be to add sound.
Right now the game is completely silent which makes it feel empty.
Adding a soundtrack would make tha game more pleasant to play and adding sound effects would make the game feel more alive.

The last improvement for this section would be distance fog.
The world is infinite and is constantly generated which makes looking into the distance weird.
At a certain distance the world just stops and if the player moves in that direction the world will just appear out of nowhere.
This undesirable effect could be completely hidden by a fog.
