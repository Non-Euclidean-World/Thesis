\section{Fighting improvements}
Better fighting system. Right now the bots shoot the player and the player can shoot and kill the bots. 
However, the bots cannot kill the player and there is no point to killing the bots. 
It does not reward the player is any way.
The bots could drop resources which the player could use to build items or structures.

The weapon selection is also very limited.
Both the player and the bots only have access to a single gun.
Other kinds of weapons could be added, especially interesting among those would be weapons that explode the terrain.
The game allows for terrain modification so weapons like grenades or rocket launchers could be more realistic and fun to use than in games where the terrain is static.

If multiple weapons were added multiple types of bots could exist.
Some bots with one type of weapon and some with another.
Even bots that are not hostile could be added.
