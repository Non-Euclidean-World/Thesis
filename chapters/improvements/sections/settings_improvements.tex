\section{Settings improvements}
The settings menu is quite simple.
It gives the player the options to start a new game, load a game, delete a save, and quit the game.
These are the most important features and they work as intended.
However, the menu could use some more features especially considering how much work went into creating the menu framework described in \autoref{sec:two_dimensional_graphics} and how nice to use the framework is.

These features include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Changing the resolution of the game,
    \item Changing the language of the game,
    \item Changing the render distance,
    \item Changing the FPS limit,
    \item Customizing the controls.
\end{itemize}
