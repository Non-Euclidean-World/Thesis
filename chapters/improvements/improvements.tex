\chapter{Improvements} \label{ch:improvements}
Creating a video game is a process that is never truly finished.
There is always some adjustment to make, some bug to fix or some new feature to add.
\textit{Minecraft}, one of the games that inspired this project, and one of the most popular games of all time, is still being updated regularly despite being released 2011.
This game is no different.
Many improvements could be made, some of which are discussed in this chapter.
It will focus on improvements and additional features but not bugs as existing problems are discussed in \autoref{ch:problems}.
