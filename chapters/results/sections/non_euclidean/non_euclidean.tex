\section{Depicting non-Euclidean spaces}
One of the main features of the game is the ability to explore non-Euclidean spaces.
To assess our depictions of non-Euclidean spaces, we decided to compare them with the ones from the game \textit{Hyperbolica}\footnote{\url{https://codeparade.itch.io/hyperbolica}} by \textit{CodeParade}.
