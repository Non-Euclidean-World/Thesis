\section{Gameplay}
\textit{Hyper} was designed as an \textit{open world} game.
In a game of this type, the player is not constrained to achieving a specific goal and has a large degree of freedom to explore, interact with, or modify the game environment \cite{Open-World-MW}.
In this section, we'll show the various aspects of this concept in our game.
