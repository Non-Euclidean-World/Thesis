\subsection{Exploring the game world}
The game starts in one of the various "landscapes" such as a desert, a forest, etc. each characterized by different terrain generation parameters and colors.
Some of the possible terrains are shown in \todo{add screenshots}.

To make exploring the game world easier, the player can get into a car that moves considerably faster than the player.
\autoref{fig:car-in-hyperbolic} shows the car driving in hyperbolic space.

Even though the car is much faster than the player it can roll over when traversing a particularly bumpy terrain.
For this reason, we included an option to flip the car back on its wheels when that happens.
