\subsection{Interacting with the world's inhabitants}
To make the world more interactive we decided to populate it with NPCs also called bots.
Bots can be either hostile toward the player or neutral.
Hostile bots shoot projectiles and walk toward the player once they get into the player's proximity.
A group of bots shooting projectiles at the player in spherical space is shown in \autoref{fig:firing-squad}.

The neutral bots are unbothered by the player's presence and just walk around.
This can change, however.
Once the player shoots at a neutral bot, it'll become hostile.
