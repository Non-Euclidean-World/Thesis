  abstract = {Curved spaces are very un-intuitive to our eyes trained on Euclidean geometry. Games provide an interesting way to explore these strange worlds. Games are written with the help of modeling tools and game engines based on Euclidean geometry. This paper addresses the problem of adapting 3D game engines to the rules of curved spaces. We consider the conversion of Euclidean objects, geometric calculations, transformation pipeline, lighting and physical simulation. Finally, we identify where existing game engines should be modified.},

abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Pixel Stream Editor. This forms the basis for an interactive synthesizer for designing highly realistic Computer Generated Imagery. The designer works in an interactive Very High Level programming environment which provides a very fast concept/implement/view iteration cycle.Naturalistic visual complexity is built up by composition of non-linear functions, as opposed to the more conventional texture mapping or growth model algorithms. Powerful primitives are included for creating controlled stochastic effects. We introduce the concept of "solid texture" to the field of CGI.We have used this system to create very convincing representations of clouds, fire, water, stars, marble, wood, rock, soap films and crystal. The algorithms created with this paradigm are generally extremely fast, highly realistic, and asynchronously parallelizable at the pixel level.},
